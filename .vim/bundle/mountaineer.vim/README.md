## Installation

Move `colors/*` into your Vim colors folder, usually `~/.vim/colors` or `~/.config/nvim/colors` and set `colorscheme mountaineer{-grey|light}` in your Vim config.

There are also colorschemes for many different terminals and a Rofi theme included as well. If you would like to add a colorscheme for another app, please create a pull request.
